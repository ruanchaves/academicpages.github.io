Join me in my undergraduate thesis defense, conducted in Portuguese, where I provide a comprehensive overview of my research focused on the applications of Transformer architectures in Natural Language Processing. 

In this presentation, I delve into the topics of semantic similarity, textual inference, and word segmentation. My thesis advisor, Nádia Félix Felipe da Silva, and Thierson Couto Rosa, the second member of the committee, were present during this defense. The defense took place on August 11, 2020, at 4:30 PM.
